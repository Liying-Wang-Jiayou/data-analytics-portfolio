# Nobel Prize Winners Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project explores the history of Nobel Prize winners using data visualization and exploratory data analysis techniques. The goal is to uncover long-term trends in Nobel Prize distribution across countries, genders, and scientific fields.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical trends in Nobel Prize awards
- Explore distribution of laureates by country and discipline
- Investigate gender representation among Nobel Prize winners
- Visualize key patterns using data storytelling techniques

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and formatting
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series trend analysis
- Country and category distribution analysis
- Gender representation analysis
- Data visualization and storytelling

## Key Insights
- Nobel Prize distribution has shifted significantly over time
- Certain countries dominate Nobel Prize counts historically
- Gender representation has improved but remains uneven
- Scientific disciplines show different long-term trends
- Visualization reveals hidden patterns in award history
