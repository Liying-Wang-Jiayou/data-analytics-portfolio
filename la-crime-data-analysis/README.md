# LA Crime Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes crime data from Los Angeles to identify patterns in criminal activity, including time trends, location distribution, and crime type frequency. The goal is to explore real-world public safety data and extract meaningful insights using data analysis techniques.

## Objectives
- Explore temporal patterns of crime occurrences
- Identify the most common types of crimes
- Analyze crime distribution across locations
- Generate insights from real-world urban data

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-based pattern analysis
- Crime frequency and distribution analysis
- Data visualization

## Key Insights
- Crime frequency varies significantly by time of day and location
- Certain crime categories dominate overall incident counts
- Clear temporal patterns exist in crime activity
- Data visualization helps reveal urban safety trends

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by DataCamp for educational purposes.
